# **Introduction to Machine Learning**
---
This repository provides a comprehensive introduction to Machine Learning, covering fundamental concepts, key differences between Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML), and essential steps in building ML models. Additionally, it includes code snippets for importing libraries and datasets in Python to get started with hands-on ML tasks.

## **Contents**

### **1. Notes**
- **Introduction to Machine Learning**: Overview of how ML allows computers to improve performance based on experience.
- **Difference Between AI and ML**: Understanding AI as a broader field and ML as a subset focused on data-driven learning.
- **How is Machine Learning Different from Traditional Programming?**: Insights into how ML automates tasks by learning patterns from data, unlike explicit programming.
- **Why Machine Learning?**: Discussion on the significance of ML in modern applications and its advantages in handling complex, data-intensive tasks.
- **Machine Learning Objectives**: Key goals, including data classification and predictive modeling.
- **Machine Learning Algorithm Classification**: Overview of supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning approaches.
- **How to Import Libraries and Dataset in Python**: Basic instructions for setting up Python libraries and loading datasets for ML projects.

### **2. Code**
- **Importing Libraries**: Example code demonstrating how to import essential ML libraries such as **numpy**, **pandas**, and **scikit-learn**.
- **Loading Dataset**: Sample code for loading and exploring the Iris dataset using **pandas** and **scikit-learn**.

## **Getting Started**
To begin with the code examples, make sure you have Python installed and the necessary libraries set up. You can install them using the following command:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn jupyter
```
