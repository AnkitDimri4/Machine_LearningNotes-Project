# **Linear Regression Notes & Projects**
---
This repository provides a comprehensive guide to understanding and implementing Linear Regression, both using Python's **scikit-learn** library and from scratch. The notes and code examples cover the intuition behind linear regression, its implementation, and how to apply it to real-world datasets.

## **Contents**

### **1. Linear Regression**
- **Intuition for Linear Regression** A detailed explanation of the linear regression model using the formula $$Y = b1X + b0 + e$$.
  - **Key Concepts**
    - Understanding the formula $$Y = mx + c$$ where $$m$$ is the slope and $$c$$ is the intercept.
    - Visual representation of the relationship between independent and dependent variables.
  - **Implementation Steps**
    - Importing necessary libraries.
    - Creating the dataset.
    - Splitting the data into independent (X) and dependent (Y) variables.
    - Fitting the linear regression model.
    - Plotting data points and the regression line.

### **2. Implementation Using 'sklearn'**
- **Linear Regression Using 'sklearn' Library**
  - **Dataset Preparation**
    - Loading and exploring datasets using **pandas**.
    - Creating binary dataframes for regression tasks.
  - **Model Fitting**
    - Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.
    - Fitting the model using **LinearRegression** from **sklearn**.
    - Predicting values and visualizing the results with plots.

### **3. Implementation Without 'sklearn' - Part 1**
- **Manual Implementation of Linear Regression**
  - **Coding the Algorithm from Scratch**
    - Calculating the mean, slope, and intercept manually.
    - Writing a custom Linear Regression class to fit and predict data.
    - Example code to demonstrate the manual fitting process.

### **4. Implementation Without 'sklearn' - Part 2**
- **Further Manual Implementation**
  - **Real-World Example**
    - Applying the custom Linear Regression model to a dataset (e.g., **salary_data.csv**).
    - Splitting the data, fitting the model, and visualizing the relationship between years of experience and salary.
    - Detailed examples and plots showcasing the implementation.

## **Getting Started**
To replicate the code examples in this repository, Please make sure you have Python installed along with the required libraries. You can install them using the following command:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
```

Explore the different sections to understand how Linear Regression works and how it can be implemented in Python for both simple and complex datasets.
