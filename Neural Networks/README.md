This repository covers the fundamentals of **Neural Networks**, focusing on understanding the key concepts, forward and backward propagation, AND/XOR gate implementation, and a project on **MNIST Handwriting Recognition**. The content provides theoretical insights, detailed notes, and practical implementations in Python.

## **Contents**

### **Introduction to Neural Networks**
- **Definition** Neural Networks are computing systems inspired by the biological neural networks in animal brains. They consist of layers of interconnected nodes (neurons) that learn from data.
- **Neurons** The basic unit of a neural network. It receives input, processes it with an activation function, and passes the output to the next layer.
- **Activation Functions** Mathematical functions that determine if a neuron should be activated. Common functions include Sigmoid, ReLU, and Tanh.
- **Applications** Neural networks are widely used in areas like pattern recognition, financial forecasting, control systems, and mobile computing.

### **Forward and Backward Propagation**
- **Forward Propagation** The process of passing input data through the network to generate output. Each layer's output becomes the input for the next layer until the final output is produced.
- **Backward Propagation** A learning algorithm used to adjust the weights of the network based on the error of the output. It works by calculating the gradient of the loss function and updating the weights using gradient descent.

### **Implementation of AND Gate using Neural Networks**
- **AND Gate** Implemented using a perceptron model with weights and biases. It performs a binary classification to determine the AND relationship between inputs.

### **Implementation of XOR Gate using Neural Networks**
- **XOR Gate** A more complex gate implemented using a neural network with a hidden layer. It demonstrates the non-linear capabilities of neural networks by solving the XOR problem, which cannot be solved using a single perceptron.

### **MNIST Handwriting Recognition using Neural Networks**
- **Problem Statement** Classify handwritten digits (0-9) using a neural network. The dataset contains images of handwritten digits, and the goal is to predict the correct digit for each image.
- **Model Structure** 
  - **Input layer** Each image is flattened into a 784-dimensional vector.
  - **Hidden layer** A dense layer with a specified number of neurons and an activation function (e.g., ReLU).
  - **Output layer** A dense layer with 10 neurons corresponding to the digits 0-9, using the softmax function for classification.
- **Training and Evaluation** The model is trained using the **Adam optimizer** and **cross-entropy loss**. Evaluation metrics include accuracy and confusion matrix visualization to assess model performance.

## **Getting Started**
To run the code examples in this repository, make sure you have Python and the following libraries installed 

```bash
pip install tensorflow keras numpy matplotlib seaborn
```

This repository provides a solid foundation for understanding neural networks and their practical applications in projects like MNIST classification.
