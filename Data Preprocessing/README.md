# **Machine Learning Notes & Projects**
---
This repository offers an in-depth exploration of Machine Learning concepts, with a focus on Data Preprocessing techniques. The notes and code examples provided aim to guide you through essential steps such as Data Cleaning, Transformation, and Reduction, making it a valuable resource for anyone working with machine learning models.

## **Contents**

### **1. Data Preprocessing**
- **Introduction to Data Preprocessing** Overview of preprocessing steps to prepare raw data for analysis.
  - **Data Cleaning**
    - What is Data Preprocessing?
    - Handling Missing Values (Coding Examples Included)
    - Data Cleaning Techniques: Removing inaccuracies and correcting inconsistencies in the data.
    - Noisy Data Handling and Binning: Techniques to smoothen and manage noisy data.
  - **Data Transformation**
    - Normalization: Scaling data to a smaller range.
    - Standardization: Adjusting data to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.
    - Attribute Selection: Reducing the dimensionality of data.
    - Discretization: Converting continuous data into discrete categories.
    - Concept Hierarchy Generation: Organizing attributes into different levels of abstraction.
  - **Data Reduction**
    - Principal Component Analysis (PCA): Reducing dataset dimensionality while preserving variance.
    - PCA Process and Coding Examples: Step-by-step code to perform PCA using Python.

### **2. Code**
- **Data Cleaning Code Examples** Practical examples demonstrating handling of missing values, noisy data, and normalization.
- **Data Transformation Code Examples** 
Includes normalization, standardization, and PCA using Python's **scikit-learn**.
- **Visualization** Visualization techniques to illustrate the results of PCA.

## **Getting Started**
To replicate the code examples in this repository, make sure you have Python installed and the required libraries. You can install them using the following command:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
```
