# **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) Notes & Implementation**
---
This repository delves into **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**, covering their fundamental concepts, architecture, components, and a project on **MNIST Handwriting Recognition** using CNNs. It provides theoretical insights, detailed notes, and practical implementations in Python.

## **Contents**

### **Introduction to Convolutional Neural Networks**
- **Definition** CNNs are a type of deep neural network primarily used for analyzing visual data. They excel in identifying patterns and features in images by applying convolutions and pooling.
- **Basic Architecture** CNNs consist of several layers: convolutional layers, activation functions, pooling layers, and fully connected layers.
- **Components** 
  - **Convolution** Extracts features from input images using filters. Parameters include depth, stride, and zero-padding.
  - **Non-Linearity (ReLU)** Introduces non-linearity by replacing negative values with zero.
  - **Pooling** Reduces dimensionality while retaining important features. Common methods are max pooling and average pooling.
  - **Classification (Fully Connected Layer)** Uses the features extracted by convolutional and pooling layers to classify the input.

### **MNIST Handwriting Recognition using Convolutional Neural Networks**
- **Problem Statement** Classify handwritten digits (0-9) from the MNIST dataset using a CNN. The dataset consists of images of handwritten digits, and the goal is to predict the correct digit for each image.
- **Model Structure** 
  - **Convolutional Layers** Apply convolutions to extract features.
  - **Activation Function** ReLU introduces non-linearity.
  - **Pooling Layers** Reduce dimensionality.
  - **Fully Connected Layer** Outputs predictions for the digit classes.
- **Training and Evaluation** The model is trained using the **Adam optimizer** and **cross-entropy loss**. Evaluation includes accuracy and confusion matrix visualization.

## **Getting Started**
To run the code examples in this repository, make sure you have Python and the following libraries installed

```bash
pip install torch torchvision numpy matplotlib scikit-learn
